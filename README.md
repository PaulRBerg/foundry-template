A Foundry-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

## What's Inside

- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/forge): compile, test, fuzz, debug and deploy smart contracts
- [PRBTest](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-test): modern collection of testing assertions and logging utilities
- [Forge Std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std): collection of helpful contracts and cheatcodes for testing
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/paulrberg/foundry-template/generate) button at the top of the page to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if you prefer to install the template manually:

```sh
forge init my-project --template https://github.com/paulrberg/foundry-template
cd my-project
yarn install # install solhint and prettier and other goodies
```

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the [installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so for details about their specific features, please consult their respective documentations.

For example, for Foundry, you can refer to the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). You might be in particular interested in reading the [Writing Tests](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests.html) guide.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .commitlintrc.yml
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solhintignore
├── .solhint.json
├── .yarnrc.yml
├── foundry.toml
└── remappings.txt
```

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Conventional Commits

This template enforces the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for git commit messages.
This is a lightweight convention that creates an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write automated
tools on top of.

### Git Hooks

This template uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run automated checks on commit messages, and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format the code with Prettier when making a git commit.

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing [PRBTest](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-test) and inherit from it in your test contract. PRBTest comes with a
pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) environment accessible via the `vm` property. You can also use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog), whose logs you can see in the terminal output by adding the `-vvvv` flag.

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol).

## Usage

Here's a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Foo.s.sol:FooScript --fork-url http://localhost:8545 \
 --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the [Solidity Scripting tutorial](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html).

### Format

Format the contracts with Prettier:

```sh
$ yarn prettier
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

## Notes

1. Foundry piggybacks off [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage dependencies. There's a [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html) about how to work with dependencies in the book.
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful when debugging and testing against a mainnet fork.
